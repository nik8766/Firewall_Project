# Firewall_Project
This project configures iptables firewall rules on a Linux server to control incoming, outgoing, and forwarded traffic. It includes setting up a client-server network with a gateway, enabling IP forwarding, and routing SSH/Telnet traffic using DNAT/SNAT for secure network management.
